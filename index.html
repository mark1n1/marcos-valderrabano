      <p>
        I was born in California but almost my entire life I was raised in Mexico, my primary language is Spanish, and my whole family is from Mexico as well.
      </p>
      
      <p>This page is intended to describe a little about me, and later on to show my abilities on web development by improving this website.</p>
      <p> Currently working in IT and want to get involved into the world of front end development. Joined Correlation One to improve my skills on mastering React, so far I'm having a blast with this program and hope to continue challenging myself. </p>
      <h2>Things that I like to do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Play videogames with my friends.</li>
        <li>Hang out with more friends!.</li>
        <li>Play guitar</li>
        <li>Go to the movies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why am I creating this page?</h2>
      <p>
        It's homework... but seriously mostly because this page will be updated over time, and it will look more professional
        and also the main purpose is to show the improvement of my skills by implenting more functionalities. (Those will come soon)
        This page also has the goal of showing employers my capabilities and enthusiasm I am for working as a software developer.
